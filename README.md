# PRODIGY_ML_02
Create a K-means clustering algorithm to group customers of a retail store based on their purchase history.
I have created this using the Scikit Learn to trtain my model. The Kaggle Dataset link is https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/vjchoudhary7/customer-segmentation-tutorial-in-python?select=Mall_Customers.csv
I have tried to chcek this using the parameters of Age and the Annual Income Separately and found out that the score was more using the parameter of Annual income
For the value of K(no of clusters) I have used the used the Elbow method and it turned out to be pretty successful.
I have tried to visualize the data in each and every  step so that it becomes easy for me to understand the difference.
Hope this helps.
